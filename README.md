# Export-Milestone-Info
Easy simply why to get a list IP, MAC and more of infomation out of Milestone VMS.
I needed a simple, straightforward method, something an end-user or junior technician can achieve without installing something on the NVR using the Milestone Management application.
So, I extracted the data required for the exportable config .XML file for the older versions of Milestone and the newer versions from the Configuration PDF.
I did this in Excel with VBA. I'm not an expert with VBA, so if you can contribute, please share it.
The VBA workbook loops through the data and populates it in a usable table.
